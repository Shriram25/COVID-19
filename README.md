# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project. 

Analyzed  COVID related data across five states in the United States. The data comprised of daily COVID cases along with the location,gender and other attributes and number of deaths occuring each day. 

I analyzed the data with the hypothesis that the death rate is higher amongst elderly people. I used Python and Pandas to analyze the data and visualize the data using matplotlib.  My hypothesis was validated and found to be true.  I summarized the findings and presented this in the form of a powerpoint presentation.
